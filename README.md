# C++ containers
# Implemented Containers and Data Structures:
BigInteger: A class for handling large integers, providing arithmetic operations for numbers beyond the standard integer limits.

Deque: An implementation of a double-ended queue, allowing efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.

RingBuffer: A circular buffer with fixed capacity, useful for implementing a queue with a constant time complexity for enqueue and dequeue operations.

Matrix: A class for handling matrices, including basic matrix operations such as addition, multiplication, and transposition.

String: A custom string class implementation, demonstrating basic string manipulation functionalities.

Search Tree with Smart Pointers: A search tree (e.g., binary search tree) implemented using smart pointers for efficient memory management.
